# Contributing

## Introduction

First, thank you for considering contributing! It is people like you that make the open source community such a great community! ðŸ˜Š

We welcome any type of contribution, not just code. You can help with:

- **QA**: file bug reports, the more details you can give the better (e.g. screenshots with the console open)
- **Marketing**: writing blog posts, how to's, printing stickers, ...
- **Community**: presenting the project at meetups, organizing a dedicated meetup for the local community, ...
- **Code**: take a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/IvaDey/enum-factory/issues). Even if you can't write code, commenting on them and showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.

## Your First Contribution

If you're new to open source, check out [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

Steps for contributing:
1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Create a branch for your changes:

```
Example: feat/add-color-enum.
3. Make your changes, ensuring they pass all lint and test checks.
4. Push your changes and open a pull request.

## Submitting code

### Before You Begin

    - What problem does this solve?
    - How can it be verified?
    - Any trade-offs or limitations.
  - Relevant tests for new or updated functionality.
  - Updated documentation if your changes affect public APIs, behavior, or usage.
- Keep your changes focused and well-scoped:
  - Break down large pull requests into smaller, manageable parts.
- Follow the [commit message guidelines](#commit-types).

### Review and Merge Process
- Once submitted, your pull request will be reviewed by a maintainer
- Ensure all CI checks pass before requesting a review.
